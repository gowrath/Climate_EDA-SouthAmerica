# Project2_SOwyang_JBang


With your team members, prepare a 1 to 2 page proposal about the questions that you intend to ask of the data. 

The proposal should describe:

- Names of team members,
- Name of your team's GitHub repository,
- A primary dataset you intend to analyze,
- Initial plots, figures, or tables,
- Some of the variables (column names) you intend to explore and what kind of insights you expect to glean,
- Supplemental datasets, if any, to complement your primary dataset - this means links, columns that you'll join on, etc.,
- What you plan to cover in the final report and how you plan to organize it.

#### In-Class Presentation (20%)
The final class will include a 10 minute presentation per group with a 5 minute question/answer period. The presentation should include:
- Your overall question
- The steps your group took to analyze the question
- Any assumptions you made in the analysis
- The key is to aim for clarity and telling a story with the data
- Organize your argument clearly
- Guide the listeners through the evidence in the data
- Include any key figures/plots/charts or graphs
- You do not need to show any code but it might be handy to have the code ready in case there are some questions on it
